For this project, I will be making use of NCAA Basketball data. I will use a subset of their data - leveraging their ‘play-by-play’ data for the 2016 season, which documents in-game action. The NCAA is the National Collegiate Athletic Association which is the primary organizer regulating college sports in the United States of America. The basketball played in the NCAA is widely considered to be among the best sporting leagues in basketball. Memorably, the NCAA organizes an annual women and men's basketball knock-out style competition to crown the US National College team. This tournament is colloquially referred to as March Madness.

The data in the above dataset has been made available to the general public via Google’s public datasets. The data has two owners listed:
Sportradar: Copyright Sportradar LLC. 
NCAA®: Copyright National Collegiate Athletic Association. 

The data can be used for limited purposes, including research and testing purposes, but may not be used for commercial or business purposes. There is a further clause, indicating that the data may “not be exploited for any purposes.” Presumably, this is included to limit and prevent the use of this data for teams to gain an unfair advantage and/or to prevent the data from being exploited for the purpose of gambling.

The dataset is fascinating due to the high level of detail it can provide about the outcome of basketball games; it includes data on the teams winning and losing, the players involved, the contribution of each player, the venues at which games are played, what the attendance was at each game. It goes into a granular level capturing events occurring within the game, like points scored, turnovers of the ball, and where on the court each event occurred.

This dataset could answer the following questions:
- Who is the top scoring player in each league for the season?
- Who is the top rebounding player in each league for the season?
- Which venues have the best attendance record?
- What is the shooting percentage (shots made/shots taken) of each player?
- Which players were the top scorers on their team?
